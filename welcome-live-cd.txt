<big><b>Welcome to BunsenLabs Live!</b></big>

This CD-sized 'Live' operating system allows you to test BunsenLabs without making any changes
to your computer's hard drive. Among other things, it can be used to check hardware compatibility
(your network connection, monitor, keyboard, etc...), to perform system recovery or to work
anonymously on a public computer.


Keyboard shortcuts for some common applications are listed on the desktop
('Super' is also called the Windows key).
You can change your keyboard layout by running this command in a terminal:
setxkbmap xx
where xx is the country code for your keyboard layout.
(See /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.lst for a full list.)

Right-click the desktop to access the system Main Menu, or use the keyboard shortcut shown.
(You can change keyboard shortcuts from the Menu "Display Keybinds" submenu.)

Your username is '<b>user</b>' and your password is '<b>live</b>'.
You already have sudo permissions.

To install this operating system to a hard drive, reboot and choose 'Install' (or 'Text Install')
from the boot menu instead of 'Live'.

To make this ISO image fit onto a CD, many default applications included in the "standard" images
were left out, resulting in some Main Menu entries that do nothing, or less "user friendly" substitutions.
All of those packages can be installed by running two commands in a terminal
(please make a note of them!)...

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install bunsen-meta-all

If instead you pick-and-choose which applications to install, you can edit the menu to remove "dead" entries.
See "Main Menu>Help &amp; Resources>Bunsen Help Files>How to Edit Menu" for more information.


					Thank you for trying <b>BunsenLabs Linux</b>!
