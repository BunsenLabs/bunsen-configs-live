<big><b>Welcome to BunsenLabs Live!</b></big>

This 'Live' operating system allows you to test BunsenLabs without making any changes to your
computer's hard drive. Among other things, it can be used to check hardware compatibility
(your network connection, monitor, keyboard, etc...), to perform system recovery or to work
anonymously on a public computer.


Keyboard shortcuts for some common applications are listed on the desktop ([S] means Super,
also called the Windows key). Right-click the desktop to access the system Main Menu, or use
the keyboard shortcut shown.

Your username is 'user' and your password is 'live'.
You already have sudo permissions.

To install this operating system to a hard drive, reboot and choose 'Graphical Install' (or 'Install')
from the boot menu instead of 'Live'.

NOTE: In order to save space, this 'CD' install contains a limited subset of
the full BunsenLabs package collection. As a result, some menu items will not work.
After installation of the system, you can use apt-get or synaptic to install the packages you need,
or if hard disk space is no problem, installing the package 'bunsen-meta-all' will bring in everything.
Also, the apt indexes have been omitted, so you need to restore them by running
'sudo apt-get update' once, before using apt.


					Thank you for trying <b>BunsenLabs Linux</b>!
