<big><b>Welcome to BunsenLabs Live!</b></big>

This 'Live' operating system allows you to test BunsenLabs without making any changes to your
computer's hard drive. Among other things, it can be used to check hardware compatibility
(your network connection, monitor, keyboard, etc...), to perform system recovery or to work
anonymously on a public computer.


Keyboard shortcuts for some common applications are listed on the desktop
('Super' is also called the Windows key).
You can change your keyboard layout by running this command in a terminal:
<b>setxkbmap xx</b>
where xx is the country code for your keyboard layout.
(See /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.lst for a full list.)

Right-click the desktop to access the system Main Menu, or use the keyboard shortcut shown.
(You can change keyboard shortcuts from the Menu "Display Keybinds" submenu.)

Your username is '<b>user</b>' and your password is '<b>live</b>'.
You already have sudo permissions.

To install this operating system to a hard drive, reboot and choose 'Install' (or 'Advanced install')
from the boot menu instead of 'Live'.

To make this a system more suitable for older 32-bit computers, some packages included in the "standard" image
were removed or replaced by lighter ones that use fewer system resources.
All the default packages can be installed by running two commands in a terminal
(please make a note of them!)...

sudo apt update
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends bunsen-meta-all

If instead you pick-and-choose which applications to install, you might want to edit the menu to remove "dead" entries.
See "Main Menu>Help &amp; Resources>Bunsen Help Files>How to Edit Menu" for more information.


					Thank you for trying <b>BunsenLabs Linux</b>!
