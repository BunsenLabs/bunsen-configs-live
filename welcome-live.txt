<big><b>Welcome to BunsenLabs Live!</b></big>

This 'Live' operating system allows you to test BunsenLabs without making any changes to your
computer's hard drive. Among other things, it can be used to check hardware compatibility
(your network connection, monitor, keyboard, etc...), to perform system recovery or to work
anonymously on a public computer.


Keyboard shortcuts for some common applications are listed on the desktop
('Super' is also called the Windows key).
Right-click the desktop to access the system Main Menu, or use the keyboard shortcut shown.

Your username is 'user' and your password is 'live'.
You already have sudo permissions.

To install this operating system to a hard drive, reboot and choose 'Graphical Install' (or 'Install')
from the boot menu instead of 'Live'.



					Thank you for trying <b>BunsenLabs Linux</b>!
